          <div class = "intro-text">
            <p>I am a freelance data science and visualization consultant with five years experience in using quantifiable evidence to inform stakeholders, particularly in various aspects of international development. For nearly four years, I worked at Development Initiatives, an organisation harnessing the power of data and evidence to end poverty, reduce inequality and increase resilience.</p>
            <p>My specialisms are in all stages of data analysis from processing and storage through to interpretation and visualisation. I am strong in Python, R, SQL and Excel for analysis and D3 JS, HTML and CSS for creating interactive visualisations. In the Skills and Experience tab, I have detailed many examples of my work. I specialise in real-time development finance, notably with International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) data. I have also worked across a range of other areas including nutrition financing, humanitarian assistance, disability aid, and poverty statistics. I provide services for clients of varying types and sizes but mostly in the international development and humanitarian space. My clients include United for Global Mental Health, Centre for Disaster Protection, Global Alliance for Tobacco Control, Development Initiatives and Christian Aid.</p>
            <p>Prior to working in development, I worked as a consultant in the Economic and Financial Consulting department of FTI Consulting, helping prepare expert testimony for litigation and international arbitration across many industries including telecoms, automotive and intellectual property.</p>
